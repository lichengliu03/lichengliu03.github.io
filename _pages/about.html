I study how we can continue to optimize and improve LLMs after their initial pretraining and instruction tuning. Specifically, I use RL as a tool to refine model behavior according to downstream objectives, preferences, or constraints. Previously, I worked on learning theory, with a focus on online selective prediction.</p> <p>I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://limanling.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Manling Li</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/acmonsterqiao/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Mingda Qiao</a>.</p> <p>I’m always open to collaboration, don’t hesitate to shoot me an email!</p> </body></html>
