Hi, I'm a 3rd year Maths student at Imperial College. I study how we can continue to optimize and improve large language models after their initial pretraining and instruction tuning. Specifically, I use reinforcement learning as a tool to refine model behavior according to downstream objectives, preferences, or constraints. Previously, I worked on learning theory, with a focus on online selective prediction. I have been advised by [Prof. Manling Li](https://limanling.github.io/) and [Prof. Mingda Qiao](https://sites.google.com/site/acmonsterqiao/). 

I'm always open to collaboration, don't hesitate to shoot me an email!
